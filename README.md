# PDA: Mudita's Pure Desktop App TEST

### A Boilerplate for an Easy Start with TypeScript, React, and Electron.

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Environmental Variables

Create an `.env` file and copy the contents of the `.env.example` file into it.
Provide all values marked as required to start working with the project. Add optional values
when you'll need them.

## Usage

Both processes have to be started **simultaneously** in different console tabs:

```bash
npm run dev:start:renderer
npm run dev:start:main
```

This will start the application with hot-reload so you can instantly start developing your application.

You can also run do the following to start both in a single process:

```bash
npm run develop
```

## Packaging

We use [Electron builder](https://www.electron.build/) to build and package the application. By default, you can run the following to package for your current platform:

```bash
npm run dist:all
```

This will create an installer for your platform in the `releases` folder.

You can make builds for specific platforms (or multiple platforms) by using the options found [here](https://www.electron.build/cli). E.g. building for all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux):

```bash
npm run dist -- -mwl
```

## Dev mode

To run dev mode, click 7-10 times on the phone box on "Overview" page.

## Precommit and Prettier

This project comes with both Precommit and Prettier setup to ensure a consistent code style.

## Troubleshooting

- ##### Error:
  ```
  Uncaught Error: The module '../node_modules/@serialport/bindings/build/Release/bindings.node'
  was compiled against a different Node.js version using
  NODE_MODULE_VERSION 72. This version of Node.js requires
  NODE_MODULE_VERSION 75. Please try re-compiling or re-installing
  the module (for instance, using `npm rebuild` or `npm install`).
  ```
  ##### Solution:
  ```bash
  electron-rebuild -f -w serialport
  ```
  > :warning: To omit possible issues, you should execute the above command after every dependencies update.
- ##### Error:

  ```
  Uncaught Expection:
  Error: Config schema violation: `language` should be a string
  ```

  ##### Solution:

  Same error will apply to any change that was done to settings without updating settings json. It can be manually updated by removing old settings.json and creating a new one in its place. To do that remove settings.json.
  Settings.json is located in:

  - `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\pure-desktop-app` on Windows
  - `~/.config/pure-desktop-app` on Linux
  - `~/Library/Application Support/pure-desktop-app` on macOS

  Next step is to reopen app by running `npm run develop` so app can create a new settings.json locally.
