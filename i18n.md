# Internationalization

## File and data structure

### Display language

Currently all the wording used in Mudita Center interface is collected in the form of JSON files which are located in [the src/renderer/locales/default folder](./src/renderer/locales/default/).

The default fallback file for every language is currently the English version - `en-US.json`.

Mudita Center core development team uses [Phrase](https://phrase.com/) software to translate the intreface. If you have any doubts about formatting `JSON` files used for localization purposes, please first refer to [Phrase help center](https://help.phrase.com/help).

## How to start localizing the interface

1. Create an issue with the localization you want to start working on. Please use the following scheme for the title of the issue: `[Language] localization [emoji_flag]` eg. `Polish localization ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±`. The emoji flag is a small detail that can help other community members in finding the localization they're interested in and helping you out in implementing it. Please make sure that the localization you want to implement has not been already implemented.
2. Add a `i18n` label to your new issue on GitHub.
3. Follow [the "Contributing to Mudita Center" article](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
4. As soon as you create a Pull Request with your localization we will review it and add it to the official Mudita Center distribution.
