        b. The right to request rectification of your data,
        c. The right to restrict the processing of your data,
        d. The right to request the deletion of your data (in certain situations),
        e. The right to data portability for data you have provided and that is processed automatically based on your consent or a contract, e.g., to another controller,
        f. The right to object to the processing of personal data – to the extent that processing is based on the legitimate interest of the controller or a third party.
    
    If your data is processed based on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent to the extent that the data is processed on this basis. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before its withdrawal.
    
    The scope of each of these rights and the situations in which they can be exercised are determined by legal regulations. The specific right you may exercise will depend, among other factors, on the purpose and legal basis of the data processing. To exercise the above rights, you should contact Mudita in the manner specified in section 3. We will respond to your inquiries within the timeframes provided by applicable law.
    
    If you have concerns about how Mudita processes your personal data, you may file a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority. A list of such authorities is available at this link. The jurisdiction of authorities is governed by the applicable law.
 
8. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD COUNTRIES
 
    Your personal data will generally be processed within the EEA. However, data may be transferred to Mudita's partners who process it outside the EEA, but only to the extent necessary for Mudita’s cooperation with these partners.
    
    In such cases, Mudita takes all possible measures to ensure the security of the transferred personal data, including, in particular, transferring personal data to countries that the European Commission has determined, by decision, to provide an adequate level of protection. In the absence of such a decision, Mudita ensures the security of personal data through safeguards such as the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.
    
    For more information about the applied safeguards, including obtaining a copy of them, you may contact Mudita using the methods indicated in section 3 above.
 
9. OTHER INFORMATIONS ABOUR YOUR PRIVACY / BACKUP / MANAGE MUDITA DEVICE
    The data stored on your device that is backed up using Mudita Center (e.g., contact list, call log, messages, alarms, notes, etc.) is not processed by us, and the backup is performed locally on the device where Mudita Center is installed. Similarly, when using other features of Mudita Center designed to manage your Mudita device (e.g., editing contacts, managing sounds, etc.), Mudita does not process this data.
 
    In connection with your use of Mudita Center, besides the data specified in section 4, we may process also other information (e.g., summary records of Mudita Center or Mudita device updates). However, this data is collected in a way that prevents the identification of specific users (which means that these are not personal data), including through data aggregation.
 
10. FINAL PROVISIONS
 
    This version of the Privacy Policy is effective as of 14.03.2025.
 
    In connection with the Mudita’s development and application updates, Mudita reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy.
